# Git-image training guide

This is a training guide for my Git-image process. It is currently in testing.

## Beta 1

[Beta 1 download (2022, Wednesday, June 1st)](/Training-Resources/Git-Image/Seanpm2001/Demo/Seanpm2001-Git-Image_Beginner_Training_Package_Beta1.zip?raw=true)

This is the first version of the training course. It provides a sandbox and extensive documentation to learn the process of processing images (in my way)

This example provides 5 categories, with 26 image files. If you mess up too badly, you can get another copy here, or re-extract your already downloaded copy.

This example should only take less than 5 minutes (minus the documentation) for first time users, it may take longer.
